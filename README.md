**Seoul Bike Sharing Demand Prediction**


**Business Context**


In many urban cities, rental bikes have been introduced to enhance mobility comfort. Ensuring that rental bikes are available and accessible to the public at the right time is crucial for reducing waiting times and providing a stable supply. Predicting the bike count required at each hour is essential for maintaining this stable supply and optimizing the availability of rental bikes.

**Data Description**


The dataset used in this project includes historical data related to bike sharing demand. It encompasses features such as the number of bikes rented at different times, weather conditions, and other relevant factors that influence bike demand.

**Main Libraries to be Used**


Pandas: For data manipulation and aggregation.
Matplotlib and Seaborn: For visualization and analysis of data behavior with respect to the target variable.
NumPy: For computationally efficient operations.
Scikit Learn: For model training, optimization, and metrics calculation.
Project Objectives
Data Preparation: Clean and preprocess the dataset to ensure it is suitable for modeling.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualize and analyze the data to understand patterns and relationships.
Feature Engineering: Create and select features that impact bike demand.
Model Development: Build and train predictive models to forecast bike demand.
Model Optimization: Tune model parameters and select the best-performing model.
Evaluation: Assess model performance using appropriate metrics.
Deployment: Implement the model to make predictions and provide actionable insights for bike rental operations.
